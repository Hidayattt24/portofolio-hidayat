title: "Shopee Sentiment Analysis"
publishedAt: "2025-01-01"
summary: "Sentiment analysis is a technique used to understand user opinions about a product or service. This study explores user sentiment toward Shopee on the Google Play Store by comparing three main approaches. The lexical approach uses TextBlob, which relies on the .sentiment.polarity score to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The transformer-based approach uses the BERT model (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) to generate star ratings from 1 to 5, which are then mapped to sentiment categories. Additionally, a translation-based approach is applied, using three different translation methods: Google Translate API, DeepSeek LLM, and Opus-MT (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-id-en). The study also compares the sentiment analysis results across these translation methods to assess how translation quality influences the final sentiment outcomes."
